# 306 RADIATOR

A radiator is placed in a square room. We want to know how the temperature is distributed in the room based on the radiatorâ€™s location. The temperature in the room verifies the very famous heat equation.

## How to build
```sh
$ make re
```

## Examples
```
./306radiator -h
USAGE
    ./306radiator n ir jr [i j]
DESCRIPTION
    n           size of the room
    (ir, jr)    coordinates of the radiator
    (i, j)      coordinates of a point in the room
```
